.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is intended as a somewhat compatible replacement for
.Nm sendmail .
Most programs that currently use
.Nm sendmail
for communication should be able to use
.Nm
instead.
.Pp
With no flags,
.Nm
reads standard input until it reaches either the end of file or
a special marker consisting only of a single dot on a line. This
alternative end of file marker may be disabled by specifying the
.Fl i
option. simsendmail then queues a copy of the message in the
.Pa local
queue. The message's recipients will be the
.Ar to-addresses
listed on the command line. If
.Fl t
is specified, recipients in the message's headers will be parsed and
added to any recipients specified.
.Nm
will not attempt to deliver a message with no recipients.
.Pp
After the message is queued the program attempts to signal the
.Nm simta
daemon so that it will process the local queueu.  When
run with the -s flag, it only tries to signal the
simta daemon and no message is expected.
.Pp
.Nm
may reject or correct a message if it finds fault with the message's
headers. Addresses given in the "From", "Sender", "To", "Cc", and
"Bcc" must be qualified by a domain. Simple addresses will be appended
with either the masquerade hostname or the machine name.
